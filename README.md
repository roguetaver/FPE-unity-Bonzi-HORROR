**Short Description:**
The Player arrives at a motel in a remote area to rest, but quickly finds out that something is not right, but getting to safety isn’t going to be so easy.

**Core Mechanics / System design:**
Under the Next Door is a horror game in FPE (First Person Explorer), the player is required to explore the map to escape safely with his/her belongings. The player will encounter Giant Crabs trying to devour him/her, which the player must run or die from.

**Game Environment:**
The game story happens in a motel at night, besides that there is a road in front of the motel and a cave below one of the rooms. The motel has a reception area, and 8 rooms, the player gets the key to room number 1. The cave is situated below room number 6, in which the player can find dead bodies, luggage from the previous guests, an exit tunnel and a giant crab that lives there. 
The game has slow movement (normal player movement) and fast movement (player can run), the player needs to use the running movement to escape the monster. Also there are small passages that the player has to crouch to go through. In addition, the game features sound effects that cause scare and make the player alert.

**Art:**
The game is built in a three dimensional world with PSX graphics, based on the  graphic from Playstation 1 games, the main focus was to present low resolution and low quality graphics in order to make the player feel uneasy with the game flow, dovetailing with the fear feeling of a horror game, besides that a dark lighting was used and some lamp poles were added to the game forcing the player to follow the lighting from places, such as the motel rooms, the road and other game places. Finally, the game menu was created using creepy fonts, a low brightness screen, and instructions of the player are shown in the subtitles that follow the same pattern of fonts from the menu in order to transmit the same feeling.

**Controls:**
The game uses WASD keys to move the player, mouse movement to orient the player’s vision, left mouse click to interact with the environment, hold the Control key to be in crawl position, being able to use the other controls while in crawling, and SpaceBar to jump.

**Difficulty:**
The game isn’t a hard game to beat, the idea of the game is to scare and leave the player in a constant state of unease, using the environment design, SFX and lighting.
